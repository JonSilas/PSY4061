# Pick an Experiment

Choose one of the following experiments to build in PsychoPy. Along with the PsychoPy experiment forming part of your submission, you should also provide a 1500-word summary. The summary should explain what design decisions you have made and why you made them -- specifically what research question are you addressing with your design choices. Also, briefly review the available evidence that suggests that your task is underpinned by a specific neural region or network. You should complete this summary by answering the questions given in the template document.
