# How to Submit
::: {.callout-important title="Portfolio Deadline"}
**You should submit your portfolio and your experiment no later than 12.12.25 10am**
:::
## Written component

Your write up of your experiment should form part of your portfolio that should be submitted as one document on MyLearning [here](https://mdx.mrooms.net/mod/turnitintooltwo/view.php?id=3441972) (log in to MyLearning required)

## Experiment
As part of your portfolio you should also submit your experiment built in PsychoPy. To do so you should zip your folder ([help on how to zip a file](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files/)) and upload your compressed folder to MyLearning [here](https://mdx.mrooms.net/mod/assign/view.php?id=3441973). 

Your folder should include:  
- A PsychoPy experiment file  
- A spreadsheet for trials and blocks.  
- A readme file with a brief outline of the experiment.  
- Any stimuli needed for your experiment to run.  

Your experiment should be standalone - the folder should contain everything needed to run the experiment (except an installation of PsychoPy)
